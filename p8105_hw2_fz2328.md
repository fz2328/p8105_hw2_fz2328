## Problem 1

Load the NYC Transit Data

``` r
nyc_transit = 
      read_csv("NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
      janitor::clean_names() %>%
      select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
             starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
      mutate(entry = as.logical(recode(entry, YES = "TRUE", NO = "FALSE")))
```

The csv files has loaded and the variable names are cleaned. Only
desired variabels were retained, including ada, entrance_type, entry,
line, route1, route10, route11, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, station_latitude, station_longitude,
station_name, vending. The dimension of the resulting dataset is 1868
rows and 19 columns. The data is not tidy since the some variables can
be combines, such as the routes.

-   There are 465 distinct stations.
-   There are 468 stations that are ADA compliant.
-   The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.3770492.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
nyc_transit = nyc_transit %>% 
  mutate(
         route8 = as.character(route8),
         route9 = as.character(route9),
         route10 = as.character(route10),
         route11 = as.character(route11)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
         route1:route11,
         names_to = "route_number", 
         names_prefix = "route",
         values_to = "route_name")
```

There are 56 distinct stations serve the A train. Among the stations
that serve the A train, 16 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
                         range = "A2:N550") %>% 
              janitor::clean_names() %>% 
              drop_na("dumpster") %>% 
          mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls),
                 track = "trash_wheel")
```

Read and clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
professor_trash_wheel = read_excel("Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", 
                                    range = "A2:M550") %>% 
                      janitor::clean_names() %>% 
                      drop_na("dumpster") %>% 
                      mutate(track = "professor_trash_wheel", 
                             sports_balls = NA)
```

Merge two dataset:

``` r
tidy_wheel = rbind(trash_wheel, professor_trash_wheel)
```

The new dataset `tidy_wheel` are created by combining `trash_wheel` and
`professor_trash_wheel` by variable names. The resulting dataset has 641
observations. Some key variables included in this datasets include
“date”, “weight_tons” and “volume_cubic_yards”. The total weight of
trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12 tons. The total
number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is 856.

## Problem 3

Import and clean data in `pols-month.csv`.

``` r
pols = read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         month = recode(month, "01" = "jan", "02" = "feb", "03" = "mar",
                       "04" = "apr", "05" = "may", "06" = "jun",
                       "07" = "jul", "08" = "aug", "09" = "sep",
                       "10" = "oct", "11" = "nov", "12" = "dec"),
         president = ifelse(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop")) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day))
```

Import and clean data in `snp.csv`

``` r
snp = read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year), 
         month = as.numeric(month)) %>% 
  mutate(year = ifelse(year > 20, year + 1900, year + 2000)) %>% 
  relocate(year, everything()) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "jan", "2" = "feb", "3" = "mar",
                       "4" = "apr", "5" = "may", "6" = "jun",
                       "7" = "jul", "8" = "aug", "9" = "sep",
                       "10" = "oct", "11" = "nov", "12" = "dec")) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

Import and clean data in `unemployment.csv`

``` r
unemployment = read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
         jan:dec,
         names_to = "month", 
         values_to = "unemployment_percentage") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

Join the datasets:

``` r
problem3_merge = full_join(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
                full_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The dataset `pols` contains information about national politicians who
are democratic or republican at any given time. It has 822
rows.observations and 9 columns/variables. The years in the resulting
dataset range from1947 to 2015. Some key variables in this dataset
inlcude `year` and the parties for `president`.

The dataset `snp`contains the close values of the S&P stock index on the
associated date. It has 787 rows.observations and 3 columns/variables.
The years in the resulting dataset range from1950 to 2015. Some key
variables in this dataset inlcude `year` and `close`.

The dataset `unemployment` show the unemployment percentage in each
year. It has 816 rows.observations and 3 columns/variables. The years in
the resulting dataset range from1948 to 2015.

The resulting dataset `problem3_merge` has 828 rows.observations and 11
columns/variables. The years in the resulting dataset range from1947 to
2015. Some key variables in this dataset inlcude `year` `president` and
`unemployment percentage`.
