## Problem 1

Load the NYC Transit Data

``` r
nyc_transit = 
      read_csv("NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
      janitor::clean_names() %>%
      select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
             starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
      mutate(entry = as.logical(recode(entry, YES = "TRUE", NO = "FALSE")))
```

The csv files has loaded and the variable names are cleaned. Only
desired variabels were retained, including ada, entrance_type, entry,
line, route1, route10, route11, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, station_latitude, station_longitude,
station_name, vending. The dimension of the resulting dataset is 1868
rows and 19 columns. The data is not tidy since the some variables can
be combines, such as the routes.

-   There are 465 distinct stations.
-   There are 468 stations that are ADA compliant.
-   The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.3770492.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
nyc_transit = nyc_transit %>% 
  mutate(
         route8 = as.character(route8),
         route9 = as.character(route9),
         route10 = as.character(route10),
         route11 = as.character(route11)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
         route1:route11,
         names_to = "route_number", 
         names_prefix = "route",
         values_to = "route_name")
```

There are 56 distinct stations serve the A train. Among the stations
that serve the A train, 16 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

Read and clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
professor_trash_wheel = read_excel("Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                                    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", 
                                    range = "A2:M550") %>% 
                      janitor::clean_names() %>% 
                      drop_na("dumpster") %>% 
                      mutate(track = "professor_trash_wheel", 
                             sports_balls = NA)
```

Merge two dataset:

``` r
tidy_wheel = rbind(trash_wheel, professor_trash_wheel)
```

The new dataset `tidy_wheel` are created by combining `trash_wheel` and
`professor_trash_wheel` by variable names. The resulting dataset has 641
observations. Some key variables included in this datasets include
“date”, “weight_tons” and “volume_cubic_yards”. The total weight of
trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12 tons. The total
number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is 856.
